# Game of Life

My first experiments with animation. A 100 x 100 grid implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

- From 2013 - 2014 years ago, so it uses requirejs.
- Still works, hits 60 fps.
- The grid is implemented as an SVG.
- There are references to Knockout and Mithril in here, but ultimately they are not used.
- This little project was how I first discovered `requestAnimationFrame`.
